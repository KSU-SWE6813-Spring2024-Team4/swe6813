# Deliverables

## Story points forecast

We believe we can take on 21 points this sprint because of availability constraints and given that it is a smaller sprint than Sprint 2 and 3.
 
We predict sprint velocity to be higher in the subsequent sprints as the base scaffolding of the project is completed and the team becomes more comfortable working in the codebase.  

## Decompose stories

## Sprint Burndown Chart

The [sprint burndown chart]() is available in the sprint 1 directory

## Daily scrums

Daily scrums were conducted using the Geekbot tool integrated with teams. Asynchronous communication works best for our team due to it's distributed nature, and this tool makes it very easy to constantly communicate.

[Scrum logs]() can be seen in the Sprint 1 folder.

## Pair programming

We were able to pair program on some of the foundatioal UI work. The recording can be seen [with your KSU account here](https://kennesawedu-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/personal/shamza1_students_kennesaw_edu/Documents/Recordings/SWE%206813%20UI%20Setup-20240209_125443-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=GCcP0k&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D)
